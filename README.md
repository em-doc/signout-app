# Read Me 🚑🏥

Keeping track of patients signed out to you in the emergency department is a headache. This new web-based application aims to organize information gathered during this critical period of communication so that tasks and patients may be tracked more easily.

## Getting Started

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS interface. Everything in this code is self-contained, meaning there are no dependencies or outside programs needed to operate.

## Use Cases

This is intended primarily for emergency medicine physicians who need to quickly take notes from an outgoing doctor.

## Have suggestions?

I'm all ears 👂
